# FM's Python Practise
 ## context

this is my Python practise project, not just something about basic variables and functions, but even more things also, like virtual environment...

## venv vs. vritualenv

* [comparison](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

### venv

* build an virtual environment 

  `py3 -m venv venvname`

  venvname can be anything you want, but *.venv* commonly be used. I use *.venv* and *myenv* in this project, see in 'FMPyProjects\venv-learn'
